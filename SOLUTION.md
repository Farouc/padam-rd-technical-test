## Solution Proposal

Let's approach the problem by breaking it down into manageable steps. Our goal is to find a path in an undirected graph that traverses each edge at least once with the minimum cost.

### Connectivity Check

First, we need to determine if the graph is connected, as an unconnected graph cannot have such a path. To do this, we implement a function `test_connex` that checks if all vertices are reachable from the first vertex of the graph. If not, the graph is not connected.

### Case 1: Eulerian Graph

If the graph is Eulerian (every vertex has an odd degree), then a Hamiltonian path exists, which is a path that goes through every edge exactly once. This path solves our problem. We can use a function `eulerian_path` to find an Eulerian path for an Eulerian graph.
An Eulerian path is found by starting from a random edge and follows an unvisited edge linked to one of its vertices, while prioritizing edges that do not make a bridge between connex components of the graph (a bridge edge is an edge that, when deleted, leaves the graph non connex), until all edges are visited.

### Case 2: Semi-Eulerian Graph

A semi-Eulerian graph has exactly two vertices of odd degree. In such a graph, an Eulerian path also exists, and we can start our path from one of the vertices of odd degree and end at the other. The `eulerian_path` function handles this case as well.

### Case 3: Non-Eulerian Graph

For graphs with more than two vertices of odd degree (always an even number), we need to add edges to make it semi-Eulerian. To do this, we add exactly one edge (except for two vertices) to every odd-degree vertex, where the cost of the edge is the shortest distance between the linked vertices. The two odd degree vertices that we leave out are the ones with the biggest cost in their added edge. We compute the optimal edges to add by finding the best pairing between odd vertices with minimal cost (`find_best_pairing` function).

After transforming the graph into a semi-Eulerian graph, we apply the logic from Case 2 to compute an Eulerian path on the augmented graph. Then, for each edge that was added, we replace it with the shortest path found in the original graph between its vertices.

### Example Instances

- `hard_to_choose`: Eulerian graph, so Case 1 works.
- `islands`: Non-connected graph, so we find semi-Eulerian paths on each connected component.
- `Paris_map`: Connected and non-Eulerian (nor semi-Eulerian), so Case 3 applies.

By following this approach, we can find a path that traverses each edge at least once with the minimum cost in various types of graphs.

### TO DO:
- optimize the implementation of `find_best_pairing`
- find connex components of `islands.txt` by implementing prim or Kruskal, or by using the DFScount function, defining the componenets and finding the path for each component. 
- verify the solution on `paris_map.txt` .
- Performance: Consider using more efficient data structures or algorithms, especially for operations like edge removal and addition, finding best pairs and shortest path.
